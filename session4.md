# **Session 4: Functions, Organization, and Sensors for VEX**

---

## PROS Project Structure

* PROS projects are made up of three parts
  * PROS Library (/firmware)
  * Header files (/include)
  * User code (/src)

---

## PROS Header Files

* api.h: contains PROS API functions such as `motor_move()`
* main.h: contains user declared code i.e. anything you want to add

---

## Main PROS Functions

* `initialize()`: For setup of sensors and motors
* `opcontrol()`: To control robot motion
* `autonomous()`: For self driving

---

## Discussion

* What does `#include "api.h"` do?
* Can you explain what would happen if we did not have `#include "api.h"` in our PROS file?
