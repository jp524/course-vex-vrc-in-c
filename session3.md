# **Session 3: Functions and Problem Solving with Programming**

---

## Understanding Loops

* Loops in programming such as 'while' and 'for' let us repeat tasks in our code. They're great for handling repetive actions.
* In robotics, they are commonly used in scanning and movement.

---

## Discussion

* Why are loops essential in programming, and what are their benefits?
* Give an example of a problem that would benefit from using loops.

---

## Demo

* Let's use loops to print integers from 1 to 10.
* In the PROS opcontrol() function, we can use a loop to have the robot move its motors. Let's see how it's done.

## Probem Solving with Programming

<!-- * We will introduce problem solving strategies in programming such as breaking down the problem into simpler steps, designing an algorithm, and coding the solution, and how functions can be effective for this. -->
* Break problems down into simpler steps
* Design an algorithm for the solution
* Code the solution

---

## Discussion

* What are the key steps in problem solving through programming?

---

## Demo

* We will use our problem solving approach on a Fahrenheit to Celsius program

---

## Understanding Functions

* Functions are reusable blocks of code. You can define functions through a function name, parameters, return type, and body. All functions follow this format.
* The advantages of functions: modularity and better code organization.

---

## Discussion

* Why are functions important in programming?
* Give an example of a function
* DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself principle

---

## Demo

* Create and demonstrate a simple function in C that performs a specific task in PROS for robotics, such as a function to control motor speed.

---

## Uploading Code to VEX V5

* Introduction to the process of uploading code to the VEX V5 using PROS
* Requirments: PROS plugin and VS Code.
* Using these tools we provide step-by-step instrucitons for how to upload sample code that will control robot's motors.

---

## Discussion

* In your own words, what are the required steps for uploading a program to the VEX V5?

---

## Demo

* Let's now see how to reverse the robots motors
